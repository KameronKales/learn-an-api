## Some notes on learning an API.

* Hey Everyone! I hope you had fun at SourceCon. I was super jealous I didn't get to go.

* I have been building a sample app using a few APIs to show how you might piece a few
together. I figured I would record a video of myself working through an API so you can learn how you might do the same.

* Without further ado, lets jump in!

* I love the Lusha API, but with the free limits being a little low for my testing I am going to demo the
Full Contact API.

* The fun app I have been building at night combines the Lusha API to get a candidates email and cell phone number. Then, it takes that data and uses the Full Contact API to grab all of the candidates social media, topics they are actively involved in, and a general background on them.

* I would use this to source candidates from LinkedIn or another tool and enrich the data available on them. I intend on using this to enrich lead information for all of Glance inbound recruiting. But, thats for another day.

* Lets get started.

* Navigate to (https://www.fullcontact.com/developer/person-api/).

* Create an account by clicking the get your free key button in the middle of the screen.

* After creating an account you should be at the dashboard view.

* There is a line that says "Try Out Person API". Click there.

* Make sure you are on the person API.

* Confirm you are using the Email option in the 2nd dropdown menu. The title of this menu is "Choose Endpoint"
